The P320-M18...chosen by the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S Military, now available to you for the first time.</p>

<p>This firearm is equipped with a manual safety. A manual safety – when engaged – is designed to mechanically prevent the firearm from discharging when the trigger is pressed, either intentionally or unintentionally. You should consider whether a manual safety on a handgun is right for you based on your experience level and intended use, keeping in mind best practices for safe firearms handling. It is possible for the trigger to be unintentionally pressed even under normal handling circumstances.</p>

<p> A manual safety is designed to augment, not replace, safe firearm handling practices. You are responsible to protect against unintentional trigger movement while carrying any firearm. Even if you elect to purchase a pistol equipped with a manual safety, you must ensure that the trigger is not contacted in any circumstance other than when you intend to fire the pistol, particularly if you elect to carry your pistol with a round in the chamber.   If you have a round in the chamber and the trigger is pressed to the rear, the pistol will fire, absent an engaged manual safety.</p>
